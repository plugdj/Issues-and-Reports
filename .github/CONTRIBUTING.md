#### New to GitHub?
GitHub is primarily a development platform for people to host and share code with others, but it also features an amazing Issue tracker that even Microsoft makes good use of (hello BashOnWindows!).

To submit an issue you need to first sign up or log in at the top navigation bar. After that, just click "Issues" on our repository and click "New issue", please read out the other topics below to learn how you can submit a successful report.

#### Guide to Reporting
If you're experiencing an issue on plug.dj, the first steps you should take are to try and solve it yourself:

* Screenshot it! Sometimes they can go away and be untraceable;
* Refreshing the page or restarting the app;
* Clearing cache or app data;
* Disabling extensions;
* Trying the website in incognito mode or doing a fresh install from the stores.

If you were unable to solve it yourself, it is likely we will have to fix it on our side, but for that we need your cooperation on reports. If you're thinking about submitting a report, please:

* Ask others in a community if they experience the same as you (if applicable, sometimes you may be unable to connect!);
* Search for your issue. It may have already been reported and you could even contribute with extra info or raise awareness to how many users are being affected by it;
* Submit a report on our tracker, and most importantly: actively check on it to see how the issue is being handled or if we need you to provide extra info.

This can not only solve your issue in most cases, but also help you figure out what could be causing it and help us track it down and fix it faster.
